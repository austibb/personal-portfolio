# personal-portfolio

## Goal
The goal of this assignment was to create a website without a provided source code. This project contains an index.html and an accompanying css stylesheet (style.css). There are also photos used to represent projects completed that are featured on the portfolio page. The website is responsive to changing viewports, and uses CSS to scroll to target locations on the page when navigated from the links in the navigation bar.
