            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised in the Bay Area, I am currently a resident of Manhattan NY where I work remotely as a Customer Success Account Manager. Prior to this I was a student at the University of Washington where I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry. Despite my background, oustanding circumstances in a pandemic led me to pursue a different careeer path - in sales. I have spent the last two years assisting enterprise businesses accelerate their journey into the cloud by providing proactive support and driving business outcomes with certified partners and SMEs.

                Today, I am pursuing another discipline change. In my off hours I am most often found still behind my computer, but instead of fielding customer calls and managing projects I am working on leetcode and enriching my coding foundation. I intend to redirect my skills and energy within the tech industry, but this time working "under the hood". I hope that my time in this bootcamp can provide me with the necessary skills and experience to kickstart that journey once I complete the program in the fall.
