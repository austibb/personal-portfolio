            <p>
                Born and raised in the Bay Area, I am currently a resident of Manhattan NY with my dog Toast, where I
                work remotely as a Customer Success Account Manager. Prior to this I was a student at the University of
                Washington where I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry. Despite my background, oustanding
                circumstances in a pandemic led me to pursue a different careeer path - in sales. I have spent the last
                two years assisting enterprise businesses accelerate their journey into the cloud by providing proactive
                support and driving business outcomes with certified partners and SMEs.

                Today, I am pursuing another discipline change. In my off hours I am most often found still behind my
                computer, but instead of fielding customer calls and managing projects I am working on leetcode and
                enriching my coding foundation. I intend to redirect my skills and energy within the tech industry, but
                this time working "under the hood". I hope that my time in this bootcamp can provide me with the
                necessary skills and experience to kickstart that journey once I complete the program in the fall.

                Baking- If I am at home and in the kitchen, I will most likely be baking! I love finding new recipes and
                tweaking them so that the end product is *exactly* what I want to taste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outdoors- staying connected with the outdoors, and pushing the limits of my comfort zone and body are
                very important to me. I fell in love with rock climbing (particularly bouldering) 6 years ago. That
                hobby led me to sport climbing outdoors, hiking, and alpinism. I've summitted 3 peaks this season, and
                I'm hoping to try my hand at ice climbing for the first time in the coming winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding- programmatic thinking and problem solving has been the "fitness" for my mind. My background in
                python has been greatly helpful in teaching me the foundational skillset to learn how to approach
                learning web development and debugging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music- I have played guitar for 8 years and piano for 1. In a former life, I also performed as a singer,
                however you won't be seeing me do that again anytime soon.
